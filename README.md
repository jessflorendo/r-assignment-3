# r-assignment-3

This repository contains all of the necessary materials required for Assignment 3: R as stated in the BIO 439 assignment description. They are as follows:

.Rmd file: an R markdown file that includes all the code that constitute the html report. all code was a result from what was learned in class and extensive googling to supplement what the assignment requireed.

Markdown html: Report including findings based on given data sets. I tried to knit into a pdf but it said I needed to download an online software, and when I did download it still didn't recognize it, and my laptop is almost at full capacity because of all the coding programs, so I just went with an html.
